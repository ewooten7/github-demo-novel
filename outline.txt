The Great Gatsby, by Scott Fitzgerald


Summary Overview:

Set in Jazz Age New York, it tells the tragic story of Jay Gatsby, a self-made millionaire, and his pursuit of Daisy Buchanan, a wealthy young woman whom he loved in his youth. The book is narrated by Nick Carraway, who recounts the events of the summer of 1922, after he takes a house in the fictional village of West Egg on Long Island. There he lives among the newly rich, while across the water, in the more refined village of East Egg, live his cousin Daisy and her brutish wealthy husband, Tom Buchanan. As the summer progresses, Nick is finally invited to attend one of the dazzling parties held by Jay Gatsby, his neighbour. At Gatsby’s request, Nick invites Daisy to his house, where she and Gatsby meet again and renew their relationship. Tom soon becomes aware of the affair and confronts Gatsby at the Plaza Hotel. Daisy tries to calm them down, but Gatsby insists that he and Daisy have always been in love and that she has never loved Tom. As the fight escalates, Tom reveals what he had learned from an investigation into Gatsby’s affairs—that he had earned his money by selling illegal alcohol. Gatsby tries to deny it, but Daisy has lost her resolve to leave her husband, and Gatsby’s cause seems hopeless. Gatsby and Daisy leave together in Gatsby’s car, with Daisy driving. On the road she hits and kills Myrtle Wilson, Tom’s mistress, though her identity is unknown to Daisy, who knew only that Tom was having an affair. Terrified, Daisy continues driving, but the car is seen by witnesses. The next afternoon George Wilson, Myrtle’s widower, arrives in East Egg, where Tom tells him that it was Gatsby who killed his wife. Wilson goes to Gatsby’s house, where he shoots Gatsby and then himself. Afterward the Buchanans leave Long Island, and Nick arranges Gatsby’s funeral.
